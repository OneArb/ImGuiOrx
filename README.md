# ImGui for Orx Engine

ImGuiOrx is an integration of ImGui for the Orx Game Engine.

## Build

This library depends on ImGui (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git) hence a submodule has been used.
The VS2015 project needs an environment variable **ORX_PATH** that needs to point to the Orx base folder.

There's only a VS2015 project but you're kindly encouraged to create other projects files for other targets.

## Test application

Under **test** folder you can find a test application you can use to play with this integration.
It uses **scroll** (https://github.com/orx/scroll.git) and the repo has been added as submodule.
